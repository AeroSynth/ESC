# Piano Demo
---
This program is written in Python and uses a Intel NUC PC.

The program inputs audio from the piano and splits it into two frequency bands which are displayed in two screens

The main program is ESC_Piano.py.
The other programs are for testing various filtering functions.

The files "How_to_build_Piano_for_RPI" are not pertinent as I was unable to intall the pysci library on a Raspberry Pi 4.
